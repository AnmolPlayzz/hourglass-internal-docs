### 📦 Versioning Explained

Tymli uses **semantic versioning** with optional pre-release tags.

```text
v MAJOR . MINOR . PATCH - LABEL
```

| Part     | Example     | Meaning                                       |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `MAJOR`  | `1.0.0`     | Breaking changes. Resets `MINOR` and `PATCH`. |
| `MINOR`  | `0.1.0`     | New features (non-breaking). Resets `PATCH`.  |
| `PATCH`  | `0.0.5`     | Fixes or small improvements.                  |
| `-LABEL` | `-prealpha` | Optional pre-release label (explained below). |

### 🔖 Pre-release Labels

Use these labels to indicate development stage before final release.

| Label       | When to Use                                  | Stability          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `-prealpha` | Initial rough builds, unstable, experimental | 🚧 Very unstable   |
| `-alpha`    | First internal feature-complete version      | ⚠️ Unstable        |
| `-beta`     | Usable, still under testing                  | 🧪 Somewhat stable |
| `-rc`       | “Release candidate” for final testing        | ✅ Nearly stable    |
| *(none)*    | Official public release                      | 🎉 Stable          |
