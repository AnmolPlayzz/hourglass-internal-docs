# 🧠 AI-Powered Distraction Detection

Tymli uses AI to intelligently decide whether the user's **current active window** aligns with their **short-term goal** and assigned tasks — allowing for **adaptive distraction blocking** during focus sessions.

## 🎯 How It Works

When a focus session is started, users can optionally specify:

- A **short-term goal** (e.g. "Finish report", "Study for exam")
- One or more **assigned tasks** (e.g. `Write Introduction.md`, `Review PR #42`)

The AI model continuously evaluates the **active window title, app name, and context** to determine if the activity is *goal-aligned* or a *distraction*.

## 🔍 Detection Pipeline

```txt
1. User starts session with short-term goal
2. AI maps goal → intent → allowed context
3. Active window is monitored in real-time
4. If window doesn't match expected context:
   → Trigger warning / block (based on blocking mode)
