# ⛔ Distraction Blocking

Distraction Blocking is a core capability of Tymli that empowers users to stay in control by actively restricting access to distracting apps, websites, or even specific in-app features (like YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels) during focus sessions or scheduled intervals.

It’s designed to be effective yet respectful — adapting to user intent, device capabilities, and context.

## 🎯 What It Does

When enabled:
- Prevents launch or usage of **blocked apps, websites** and **in-app features**
- Shows nudges, overlays, or redirects to refocus user attention
- Logs every violation attempt for scoring and analysis
- Activates only during **focus sessions** or **scheduled blocks**

---

## 📱 Platform-Specific Implementation

### 🖥️ Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)

- Built using Electron + native bindings
- Uses active window polling + accessibility APIs
- If a blacklisted app is detected:
  - Shows fullscreen overlay or popup
  - Plays optional haptic/audio nudge
- Maintains a local blocklist (stored per platform)

**Windows:**  
- Uses `GetForegroundWindow()` to detect active app  
- Optionally kills process (Strict Mode)

**macOS:**  
- Uses `NSWorkspace.shared.frontmostApplication`  
- Optionally forces app switch to safe app

**Linux:**  
- X11 support only (via `xdotool`, `wmctrl`)  
- Limited support on Wayland

---

### 📱 Android

- Uses Accessibility Service to:
  - Detect foreground app
  - Draw blocking overlay when blocked app opens
- Works even in full-screen apps
- Requires **Accessibility + Usage Access** permissions

**Strict Mode:** Optionally force-redirects to home screen  
**Silent Mode:** Just logs the violation, no block UI

---

### 📱 iOS

Due to Apple restrictions:
- No true blocking is possible without MDM
- Instead:
  - Sends **distraction reminders**
  - Hides notifications
  - Uses **Shortcut automation** or **Focus Mode** APIs
- Optional ScreenTime integration via enterprise profile *(Enterprise only)*

---

### 🌐 Websites (Browser Extension)

- Uses `chrome.webRequest` + `chrome.tabs` APIs
- Blocks navigation to blacklisted domains
- Can auto-close tabs or replace with "Back to Focus" screen
- Works across all Chromium browsers (Firefox planned)

## 🧠 Blocking Modes

| Mode          | Behavior                                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ✋ Soft        | Shows warning or nudge (non-blocking)         |
| ⛔ Strict      | Forces close / redirects from distractions    |
| 🤫 Silent      | Logs silently, no UI                          |
| 🧱 Scheduled   | Enables blocking during fixed time windows    |

---

## 🔧 User Config

Users can:
- Set per-platform blocklists
- Toggle distraction categories (e.g. “Social Media”)
- Schedule daily blocking windows
- Enable/disable Strict Mode per device

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Safety

- All blocking happens **locally** — no cloud intervention
- App never records screen content
- On mobile, overlays are transparent and dismissible by force-quit

---

## 📈 Future Ideas

- Smart detection using screen OCR (local only)
- Adaptive blocklist suggestions (AI)
- Collaborative blocklists (for accountability mode)
