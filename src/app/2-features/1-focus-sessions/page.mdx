# 🎯 Focus Sessions

Focus Sessions are dedicated periods where users commit to deep, uninterrupted work. During a session, Tymli tracks distractions, provides real-time feedback, computes a productivity score, and can actively block distracting apps, websites, or even specific in-app features (like YouTube Shorts).

---

## 🔧 Core Behaviors

- Users manually start and end a session
- Session metadata:
  - Start time / end time
  - Device used
  - Duration goal (optional)
- Real-time feedback (timer, score progress)
- Option to enable “Distraction Blocking” during session
- Optional Pomodoro mode (planned)

---

## 📊 What Gets Tracked

During a session, we track:

- **App switches**
- **Device unlocks / screen pickups**
- **Usage of blacklisted apps or sites**
- **Idle time** (no user input for X seconds)
- **Early exits / incomplete sessions**

These metrics are used by the [Scoring Engine](/scoring).

---

## ⛔ Optional: Blocking Mode

When enabled, distraction-blocking kicks in:

- On **desktop**: blocks via overlay or accessibility APIs
- On **Android**: uses AccessibilityService to block apps
- On **iOS**: limited to focus reminders due to OS restrictions

---

## 🧠 Planned Features

- Pomodoro mode with short/long breaks
- Session reminders (start time, overdue breaks)
- Stats dashboard: average duration, consistency
- Tagging sessions by purpose (e.g., study, work, read)
- [Planned] Optionally auto-start sessions based on usage behavior and time-of-day patterns

---

## ⚙️ Developer Notes

- Focus sessions are stored locally first, then synced
- Events are batched and sent to the server every N seconds
- `Strict Mode` toggles whether early exits count as failed
- Ending a session triggers score computation and optional AI summary fetch

---

## 💡 Example Flow (Pseudocode)

```ts
startFocusSession(goalDurationMs, options);
  startTimer();
  startTrackingDistractions();
  if (options.blocking) {
    enableBlockingLayer();
  }

endFocusSession();
  stopTimer();
  stopTracking();
  disableBlocking();
  calculateScore();
  syncSessionToCloud();
````

> Focus sessions are the heartbeat of the app — everything else (scoring, tracking, syncing) is centered around them.
