# 🤖 AI Summaries

AI Summaries provide a quick, human-readable reflection of each focus session. They’re generated after a session ends, based on usage patterns, distractions, and duration — helping users reflect without parsing raw stats.

---

## ✨ What It Does

At the end of a focus session, the AI can generate a short summary that includes:

- Session success/failure recap
- Major distractions (apps/sites)
- Overall focus quality
- Encouraging tone (never judgmental)

---

## 📝 Sample Output

> "Solid 45-minute session! You stayed focused for most of the time, except for a brief 2-minute scroll on Instagram. Great job avoiding pickups — just 1 unlock!"

Or:

> "Distractions got the best of you today. Chrome and Discord were open for 20% of the session. Maybe try enabling Strict Mode next time?"

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Local summary context is generated** with:
   - Focus duration
   - App usage during session
   - Pickup count
   - Blocked app attempts
   - Score

2. **Small prompt payload** is sent to the AI server:
   ```json
   {
     "duration": 2700,
     "score": 64,
     "apps": ["YouTube", "Discord"],
     "pickups": 5,
     "blockedHits": 2
   }
````

3. AI responds with a single-paragraph session summary

## 🔐 Privacy & Safety

* Only **anonymized usage metadata** is sent
* No app content, screen data, or personal notes are transmitted
* Entire system is opt-in, and summaries are stored locally unless sync is enabled
